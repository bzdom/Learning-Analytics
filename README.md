# Learning Analytics
This is a pathway or a resource summary for learning Google analytics but also covers more general topics such as metrics and e-commerce that are complementary to the GA usage.

The document should be used as a guid to resources and not so much as a linear course with a beginning and an end. Also, new resources should be added as we find them.

My suggestion is to start with the outline path and get the technical basics from google. Then start taking the analytics courses (I think you can see which are the more basic ones and which are more advanced the only misleading course is "The Complete Google Analytics Course For Beginners" that I think you should take last), after you completed them and feel comfortable with the dashboards and customization I'd get the certification from google, and start digging in the business/industry specific courses and the further reading (the 'Books' and 'Additional and Topical' sections). Regarding the 'Blogs' section, I'd subscribe to them from day 1 and start reading about the industry even if a lot of things won't be clear it creates anticipation and familiarity which are both :sunglasses: learning boosters.

Please feel free to suggest corrections or changes, and to contribute with more resources and learning materials.
## Outlines & Paths

## Blogs
I think you should start following the industry blogs ASAP, even if some posts go over your head or if you find that there's a lot you don't understand it the sooner and more you are exposed to the issues the industry is dealing will and writing about, the sooner you'll get comfortable with the lingo, things will start to get familiar and you'll anticipate a lot of things you are going to learn which will be much more effective. You'll also get exposed to certain issues from different perspective and sources which will help greatly in understanding them.

You can probably get the Google certification by now but if there are subjects that you still don't feel comfortable with after viewing the outline, then move on and return later.

This is the time to get yourself into a routine of reading on specific topics and cases, and seeing things from various perspectives. These resources are just to get you started.

_A lot of this will be things you've already learned or know. This is a good thing. It indicates the transition to a professional, and to a more refreshing and reinforcing pattern of learning._:trophy:
